## Project setup (Joyin)

- Install Flutter SDK, then run `flutter pub get`.
- Generate Firebase config with `flutterfire configure` (do not hand-edit `lib/firebase_options.dart`).
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing; keep output clean.
- Run tests with `flutter test --coverage` to populate `coverage/lcov.info`.
